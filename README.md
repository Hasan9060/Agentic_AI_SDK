### 🛠 Want to customize your own?

You can fork or build your own "AI-styled" animation grid using this snake project:

- GitHub Snake Animation: [Platane/snk](https://github.com/Platane/snk)
- Customize your snake to use different colors or themes
- Add a glowing "AI node" effect using SVG filters (advanced)

---

Let me know if you want a custom SVG with a glowing **AI node trail** (instead of a snake), I can help guide you on how to make one using SVG code or through a GitHub Actions workflow. 🧠✨
